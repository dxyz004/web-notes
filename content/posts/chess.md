I've developed a web app where you can play chess against cyberpunk-inspired computer opponents.

The code is available here: 
[Cyberpunk Chess repo](https://github.com/dxyz004/cc-testing-magenta)

And is hosted to play online at: 
[Cyberpunk Chess](https://cyberpunk-chess.vercel.app/)

I've also shared this project anonymously to the greater cyberpunk fandom for potential collaboration and further enjoyment.
